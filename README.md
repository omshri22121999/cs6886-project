# Energy Profiler for DNN

The app (Android only) and the report for the course project in Systems Engineering for Deep Learning (CS6886) Fall 2020.

The app will run a Tensorflow-Lite model on a set of images and return the approximate energy consumption details, which can be sent via WhatsApp to anyone. We hope that this can be used as a rough benchmark energy consumption for DL models in Android phones. Any additions welcome.
